# fopdm -> Farm Operations Device Monero Miner
# This is a fopd module that one can use to mine monero
# It is not enabled by default and thus the fopd operator has control of 
# whether or not to use it.
# It can be configured to mine to the benefit of the fopd Monero account or
# the user can configure to mine to the benefit of their choice of Monero
# account.  The user can also choose to run mulitple copies running to 
# the benefit of mulitple Monero accounts. The percentage sharing among
# mulitple copies is also completely configurable by the user.
#
# The miner is designed not to be intrusive and thus it does not
# intentionally interfere with or overload it's host system.  
#
# Turn it on or off as you will by editing the fopd config.py file.
#
# We hope you choose to run it and apply some of it's benefit to the
# fopd teams Monero key. This will allow the fopd team to derive some
# revenue from its efforts.
#
# To enalbe to run for the beneif of the fopd team simply run [TODO]
